<h1>{{page.title}} </h1>
<p>My name is Christopher Kodama, I am currently an engineering manager at the 36th Electronic Warfare Squadron. I currently live in the Florida panhandle, USA.  I spend most of my time working on work, but on the weekends, I typically like to relax with my fiance, watch TV, or play video games.  I also enjoy messing around with using linux, as well as git and jekyll.
