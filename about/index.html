<h1>{{page.title}} </h1>
<p>My name is Christopher Kodama, I am currently a graduate student at AFIT. I currently live in Ohio, USA.  I spend most of my time working on my research, but on the weekends, I typically like to relax and spend time with my (wonderful!) girlfriend, watch TV, or play video games.  Right now I am messing around with using linux, as well as git and jekyll!  I'm learning a lot!
